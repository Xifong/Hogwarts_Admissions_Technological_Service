# Hogwarts_Admissions_Technological_Service

Pursuant to the decrees of the Ministry of Magic relating to non-magical outreach, Hogwarts is now to offer a technological admissions statistics portal HATS.
For magical users, please refer to HAMS.

Otherwise:  
Install Python 3+  
virtualenv .env && source .env/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt  
python main.py  

Generates a random set of students subject to constraints customisable in data.py and then decides whether to reject or accept them.

You'll notice there's still some work to be done on socio-magical mobility!
